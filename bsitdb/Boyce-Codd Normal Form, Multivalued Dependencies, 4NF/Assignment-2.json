			"feedback":"Since there are no functional dependencies, the only key for the original R and any decomposed relations is the set of all attributes. Thus, if there are any nontrivial MVDs for a relation at any stage in the decomposition, the left side isn't a key so the relation must be further decomposed.Suppose we start with violating MVD A ->-> B. We get AB and ACDE as a decomposition. A ->-> B is trivial in AB, so AB is in 4NF. However, ACDE has MVD A ->-> D, which follows by transitivity from the given MVDs. We therefore decompose ACDE into AD and ACE. These have no nontrivial MVDs, so {AB,AD,ACE} is one possible 4NF decomposition.We could also start from ABCDE with violating MVD B ->-> D. We get BD and ABCE as a decomposition. B ->-> D is trivial in BD, so BD is in 4NF. However, ABCE has violating MVD A ->-> B. We therefore decompose ABCE into AB and ACE. These have no nontrivial MVDs, so another decomposition is {BD,AB,ACE}.Finally, we could start from ABCDE with violating MVD A ->-> D, which follows by transitivity from the given MVDs. This process results in the same decomposition we got the first time: {AB,AD,ACE}."

If the closure is all attributes of the relation, then the attributes in S are a key; otherwise not.)All of the correct answers -- schemas that could not be part of the decomposition -- have an FD whose left side does not contain one of these keys. All of the incorrect answers -- schemas that could be part of the decomposition -- result from one or two steps of the decomposition algorithm using the given FDs.
