			"feedback":"Nonserializable behavior can be exhibited if transaction T2 performes inserts on R, or if T2 modifies both R and S. On inserts, repeatable reads allow \"phantom\" tuples to appear during a transaction. If both R and S are modified in T2, it is possible for T1 to read the state of R before T2 and the state of S after T2."

			"feedback":"Alice must see all of Betty's inserts or none of them. Alice could compute the sum before Betty or Carol does anything (answer 1000), or after Betty's inserts but before Carol's deletes (answer 1060). Alternatively, Carol could complete her deletes before Betty starts, in which case Carol has no effect(answer 1000 or 1060). Carol could complete her deletes after Betty's inserts, but before Alice reads, in which case Alice sees only 10 from among Betty's inserts (answer 1010). Since the isolation level is READ COMMITTED and not SERIALIZABLE, another possibility is that Carol starts before Betty, deleting 30 (which has no effect on R), then Betty does her inserts and commits, then Carol deletes 20, leaving 10 and 30 in R. Finally, Alice executs (answer 1040). There are no other possibilities, so the possible sums are 1000, 1010, 1040, 1060."

If all three transactions have isolation level READ UNCOMMITTED, many more things can happen. We need to consider all possible sequences of events up to the time Alice reads:<br>1.Carol does nothing or has executed her deletes before Betty inserted the integers that would've been deleted. Then Alice's sum can be 1000, 1010, 1030, or 1060, depending how far Betty has progressed.<br>2.Carol deleted 30 after Betty inserted 30, but Carol has not deleted 20 yet. Then Alice's sum is 1030.<br>3.Carol deleted 30 before Betty inserted 30, but deleted 20 after Betty inserted 20. Then Alice's sum is either 1010 or 1040, depending whether Betty has yet inserted 30.<br>4.Carol deleted 20 and 30 after Betty inserted them. Then Alice's sum is 1010.<br>Thus with READ UNCOMMITTED Alice can get a sum of 1000, 1010, 1030, 1040, or 1060. We saw with SERIALIZABLE Alice's sum can be 1000, 1010, or 1060, so 1030 and 1040 are in the difference."
