Inserting (2,3) triggers the insertion of (1,3), since the new a value of 2 matches the b value of the existing tuple (1,2). Inserting (1,3) does not (recursively) trigger the insertion of any other tuples. Inserting (3,4) triggers the insertion of (1,4) and (2,4), since the new a value of 3 matches the b value of the existing tuples (1,3) and (2,3). Inserting (1,4) does not (recursively) trigger the insertion of any other tuples. Inserting (2,4) (recursively) triggers the insertion of (1,4), since the new a value of 2 matches the b value of the existing tuple (1,2), but (1,4) is already present so a new copy is not inserted."
