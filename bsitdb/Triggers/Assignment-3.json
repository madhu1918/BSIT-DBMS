			"text":"Students at your hometown high school have decided to organize their social network using databases. So far, they have collected information about sixteen students in four grades, 9-12. Here's the schema: <br>Highschooler ( ID, name, grade ) <br>English: There is a high school student with unique ID and a given first name in a certain grade. <br>Friend ( ID1, ID2 ) <br>English: The student with ID1 is friends with the student with ID2. Friendship is mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Friend table, so is (456, 123). <br>Likes ( ID1, ID2 ) <br>English: The student with ID1 likes the student with ID2. Liking someone is not necessarily mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Likes table, there is no guarantee that (456, 123) is also present. <br>Your triggers will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. <a href=\"https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/Engineering/db/asset/socialdata.html\">View the database</a>. (You can also <a href=\"social.sql\">download the schema and data</a>.) <br> For your convenience, here is a graph showing the various connections between the people in our database. 9th graders are blue, 10th graders are green, 11th graders are yellow, and 12th graders are purple. Undirected black edges indicate friendships, and directed red edges indicate that one person likes another person."

				"text":"<b>Instructions: </b> You are to solve each of the following problems by writing one or more triggers. Our back-end creates triggers using SQLite on the original state of the sample database. It then performs a data modification statement that activate the trigger(s), runs a query to check that the final database state is correct, and restores the database to its original state. When you're satisfied with your solution for a given problem, click the \"Submit\" button to check your answer. <br> <b>Important Notes:</b> <ul><li>Our backend system is SQLite, so you must conform to the trigger constructs supported by SQLite. A guide to SQLite triggers is <a href=\"http://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html\">here</a>, although you may find it easier to start from the triggers used in the video demonstrations.</li>  <li>In the workbench and the grading program, triggers are executed with recursive triggering disabled (\"recursive_triggers=off\").</li> <li>You are to translate the English into one or more triggers that perform the desired actions for all possible databases and modifications. All we actually check is that the verification query gets the right answer on the small sample database. Thus, even if your solution is marked as correct, it is possible that your solution does not correctly reflect the problem at hand. Circumventing the system in this fashion will get you a high score on the exercises, but it won't help you learn about triggers. On the other hand, an incorrect attempt at a general solution is unlikely to behave correctly, so you shouldn't be led astray by our checking system.</li> </ul>  <br> You may perform these exercises as many times as you like, so we strongly encourage you to keep working with them until you complete the exercises with full credit.
