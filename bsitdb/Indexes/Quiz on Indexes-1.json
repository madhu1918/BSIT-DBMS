			"feedback":"The query has an equality condition on both the sensorID and time attributes of Temps. Since [sensorID,time] is a key, the query result contains either 0 or 1 tuples. <br>Scenario A: Since there are no indexes, all tuples of the table may need to be accessed to look for 'sensor541' and '05:11:02'. The number of tuples in Temps is 50 (unique sensorIDs) * 20 (number of readings per sensor) = 1000. <br>Scenario B: Using the index on sensorID, 20 readings will match the given sensorID, and all 20 tuples may need to be accessed to look for a matching time. <br>Scenario C: Using the index on time, 10 readings will match the given time, and all 10 tuples may need to be accessed to look for a matching sensorID. <br>Scenario D: Using the time index is better than using the sensorID index, so the time index is used and is the same as scenario C (10 tuples). <br>Scenario E: The index on [sensorID, time] will directly find the single matching tuple, if there is one. <br>"
